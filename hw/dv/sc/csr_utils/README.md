# CSR utilities (SystemC)

This mirrors the structure of `hw/dv/sv/csr_utils` for SystemC/UVM-SC.

- csr_utils.hpp: Common helpers for CSR read/write, bit set/clear, poll.
- csr_seq_lib.hpp: Placeholder for future SC sequences mirroring SV `csr_seq_lib.sv`.
- csr_utils.core: Placeholder to mirror SV core file structure if needed by build tooling.
